    "Do we understand precisely what the problem is asking? Do we understand all the concepts that the problem talks about?  Do we understand them well enough to implement them in a programming language? Let's take a first pass:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A set of cities**: We will need to represent a set of cities; Python's `set` datatype might be appropriate.\n",
    "- **Distance between each pair of cities**: If `A` and `B` are cities, this could be a function, `distance(A, B),` or a table lookup, `distance[A][B]`.  The resulting distance will be a real number.\n",
    "- **City**: All we have to know about an individual city is how far it is from other cities. We don't have to know its name, population, best restaurants, or anything else. So a city could be just an integer (0, 1, 2, ...) used as an index into a distance table, or a city could be a pair of (x, y) coordinates, if we are using straight-line distance on a plane.\n",
    "- **Tour**: A tour is a specified order in which to visit the cities; Python's `list` or `tuple` datatypes would work. For example, given the set of cities `{A, B, C, D}`, a tour might be the list `[B, D, A, C]`, which means to travel from `B` to `D` to `A` to `C` and finally back to `B`.\n",
    "- **Shortest possible tour**: The shortest tour is the one whose tour length is the minimum of all tours.\n",
    "- **Tour length**: The sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour (including the last city back to the first city).   Probably  a function, `tour_length(tour)`.\n",
    "- **What is ...**: We can define a function to answer the question *what is the shortest possible tour?*  The function takes a set of cities as input and returns a tour as output. I will use the convention that any such function will have a name ending in the letters \"`tsp`\", the traditional abbreviation for Traveling Salesperson Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage I have a rough sketch of how to attack the problem.  I don't have all the answers, and I haven't committed to specific representations for all the concepts, but I know what all the pieces are, and I don't see anything that stops me from proceeding."

In the fully general version of the TSP, the \"distance\" between two cities could be anything: it could factor in the amount of time it takes to travel between cities, the twistiness of the road, or anything else. The `distance(A, B)` might be different from `distance(B, A)`. So the distances could be represented by a matrix `distance[A][B]`, where any entry in the matrix could be any (non-negative) numeric value.\n",

So a city can be represented by a two-dimensional point: a pair of *x* and *y* coordinates. We will use the constructor function `City`, so that `City(300, 0)` creates a city with x-coordinate of 300 and y coordinate of 0.  Then `distance(A, B)` will be a function that uses the *x* and *y* coordinates to compute the distance between `A` and `B`.\n",

    "* **complex:** Python already has the two-dimensional point as a built-in numeric data type, but in a non-obvious way: as `complex` numbers, which inhabit the two-dimensional (real &times; imaginary) plane.  **Pro:** efficient. **Con:** a little confusing; doesn't distinguish Points from other complex numbers.\n",

    "But other times I would like to be able to do an experiment, where, for example, I call `Cities(n)` 30 times and get 30 different sets, and I then compute the average tour length produced by my algorithm across these 30 sets. Can I get both behaviors out of one function? *Yes!*  The trick is the additional optional parameter, `seed`.  Two calls to `Cities` with the same `n` and `seed` parameters will always return the same set of cities, and two calls with different values for `seed` will return different sets. This is implemented by calling the function `random.seed`, which resets the random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once I create a set of Cities, I don't want anyone messing with my set. For example, I don't want an algorithm that claims to \"solve\" a problem by deleting half the cities from the input set, then finding a tour of the remaining cities.  Therefore, I make `Cities` return a `frozenset` rather than a `set`.  A `frozenset` is *immutable*; nobody can change it once it is created. (Likewise, each city is immutable.)\n",

    "**Note:** We could say that there is only one tour of three cities, because `[1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 3, 2]` are in some sense the same tour, one going clockwise and the other counterclockwise.  However, I choose not to do that, for two reasons.  First, it would mean we can never handle TSP problems where the distance from A to B is different from B to A. Second, it would complicate the code (if only by a line or two).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can  verify that calling `alltours_tsp(Cities(8))` still works and gives the same tour with the same total distance. But it now runs faster:"

In general, the function `TSP` looks at (*n*-1)! tours for an *n*-city problem, and each tour has *n* cities, so the total time required for *n* cities should be roughly proportional to *n*!. This means that the time grows rapidly with the number of cities.  *Really* rapidly. This table shows the actual time for solving a 10 city problem, and the exepcted time for solving larger problems:\n",

    "What if we are willing to settle for a tour that is short, but not guaranteed to be shortest? Then we can save billions of years of compute time: we will show several *approximate* algorithms, which find tours that are typically within 10% of the shortest possible tour, and can handle thousands of cities in a few seconds. (**Note:** There are more sophisticated approximate algorithms that can handle hundreds of thousands of cities and come within 0.01% or better of the shortest possible tour.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we come up with an approximate algorithm?   Here are two general plans of how to create a tour:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: Make the tour go from a city to its nearest neighbor. Repeat.\n",
    "* **Greedy Algorithm**: Find the shortest distance between any two cities and include that edge in the tour. Repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will expand these ideas into full algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, here are four very general strategies that apply not just to TSP, but to any optimization problem. An **optimization problem** is one in which the goal is to find a solution that is best (or near-best) according to some metric,\n",
    "out of a pool of many candidate solutions. The strategies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Repetition Strategy**: Take some algorithm and re-run it multiple times, varying some aspect each time, and take the solution with the best score.\n",
    "* **Alteration Strategy**: Use some algorithm to create a solution, then make small changes to the solution to improve it.\n",
    "* **Ensemble Strategy**: Take two or more algorithms, apply all of them to the problem, and pick the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are two more strategies that work for a wide variety of problems:\n",
    "\n",

    "We can give `repeated_nn_tsp` an optional argument specifying the number of different cities to try starting from. We will implement the function `sample` to draw a random sample of the specified size from all the cities.  Most of the work is done by the standard library function `random.sample`. What our `sample` adds is the same thing we did with the function `Cities`: we ensure that the function returns the same result each time for the same arguments, but can return different results if a `seed` parameter is passed in.  (In addition, if the sample size, `k` is `None` or is larger than the population, then return the whole population.)"

    "At the start of the *Approximate Algorithms* section, we mentioned two ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:** Make the tour go from a city to its nearest neighbor. Repeat.\n",
    "2. **Greedy Algorithm:** Find the shortest distance between any two cities and include that in the tour. Repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to develop the *greedy algorithm*, so-called because at every step it greedily adds to the tour the edge that is shortest (even if that is not best in terms of long-range planning).  The nearest neighbor algorithm always extended the tour by adding on to the end.  The greedy algorithm is different in that it doesn't have a notion of *end* of the tour; instead it keeps a *set* of partial segments. Here's a brief statement of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Greedy Algorithm:** *Maintain a set of segments; intially each city defines its own 1-city segment. Find the shortest possible edge that connects two endpoints of two different segments, and join those segments with that edge. Repeat until we form a segment that tours all the cities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "On each step of the algorithm, we want to \"find the shortest possible edge that connects two endpoints.\" That seems like an expensive operation to do on each step. So we will add in some data structures to enable us to speed up the computation.  Here's a more detailed sketch of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-compute a list of **edges**, sorted by shortest edge first. An edge is a pair of cities; if the list contains `(A, B)` then it does not contain `(B, A)`, and it never contains `(A, A)`.\n",
    "2. Maintain a dict that maps **endpoints** to **segments**, e.g. `{A: [A, B, C, D], D: [A, B, C, D]}`. Initially, each city is the endpoint of its own 1-city-long segment, but as we join segments together, some cities are no longer endpoints and are removed from the dict.\n",
    "3. Go through the edges in shortest-first order. When you find an edge `(A, B)` such that both `A` and `B` are endpoints of different segments, then join the two segments together.  Maintain the endpoints dict to reflect this new segment. Stop when you create\n",
    "a segment that contains all the cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example: assume we have seven cities,  labeled A through G.  Suppose CG happens to be the shortest edge.  We would add the edge to the partial tour, by joining the segment that contains C with the segment that contains G.  In this case, the joining is easy, because each segment is one city long; we join them to form a segment two cities long. We then look at the next shortest edge and continue the process, joining segments as we go, as shown in the table below. Some edges cannot be used.  For example, FD cannot be used, because by the time it becomes the shortest edge, D is already in the interior of a segment. Next, AE cannot be used, even though both A and E are endpoints, because it would make a loop out of ACGDE.  Finally, note that sometimes we may have to reverse a segment.  For example, EF can merge AGCDE and BF, but first we have to reverse BF to FB. \n",

    "* **Branch and Cut**: this is a technique to cut off a search early, when a partial solution is obviously not optimal.  We saw how Held-Karp cuts off some permutations of cities when another permutation is better.  A refinement on that is to keep track of, say, the best total length of the segment going through all the Bs cities.  Then, any time you have a partial segment through some of the Bs cities that exceeds the best total, we can stop right there, before even finishing all the Bs.  With this technique, you can find optimal tours for around 50 cities.\n",
    "* **Linear programming**: Lookup the topic \"linear programming\" and see how it applies to TSP.\n",
    "* **Heuristic Algorithms**: There are many approaches for using heurisitic estimates to find good (but not optimal) tours.  For example, *ant colony optimization algorithms* make random choices of which edge to follow, and then the edges that occur in the best tours get reinforced with some virtual pheromones, and other ants tend to follow those pheromones. *Simulated annealing* takes its inspiration from metallurgy.\n",
    "* The **[Lin-Kernighan heuristic](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/LKH-1.3/DOC/LKH_REPORT.pdf)**  is one of the best.\n",
    "* The **[Christofides algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm)** gives a guarantee of 3/2 the optimal tour length (improving on the minimum-spanning-tree guarantee).\n",
    "* `altered` as a function: we defined a lot of one-line functions that just called another algorithm, and then calls `alter_tour` on the result.  Can you write a function, `altered(func)`, which takes a TSP algorithm as argument, and returns a TSP algorithm that does the original algorithm and then calls `alter_tour`?\n",
    "* Why does `mst` produce an optimal result, while `greedy_tsp` does not, even though the two algorithms have similar structure in the way they iterate over `shortest_edges_first`?\n",
    "* The code in this notebook was designed for clarity, not efficiency.  Can you make the code faster?\n",
