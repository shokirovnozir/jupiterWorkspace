    "In the output, we see that our heuristic gets called, although it does nothing yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing the heuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the heuristic is to take a given solution and try to find a better one by `uncrossing` pairs of edges.\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a path like the following.\n",
    "![1.png](attachment:1.png)\n",
    "Let us give a direction to this path, say, 0-1-3-2-4-5-0.\n",
    "We can try to uncross the edge 1-3 with 2-4 and see if this gives a better solution.\n",
    "By uncrossing two edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ we mean to remove the edges and introduce instead $(h(e_1), h(e_2))$ and $(t(e_1), t(e_2)$, where $h(e)$ is the `head` of the edge (the first node in the edge) and $t(e)$ is the `tail` (the second node).\n",
    "Of course, `head` and `tail` only make sense when there is a direction, but we gave one to the path.\n",
    "By 'uncrossing' the pair of edges 1-3 and 2-4, we get 1-2 and 3-4, which yields the following path.\n",
    "![2.png](attachment:2.png)\n",
    "**Note** we had two options to replace 1-3 and 2-4. The uncrossing gave 1-2 and 3-4, but we could also replace them with 1-4 and 3-2. Doing this yields\n",
    "![3.png](attachment:3.png)\n",
    "As you can see, this disconnects the path and is not a valid operation. This is the reason why we need to orient the path and define the uncrossing as above. If we do not orient the path, in principle, we have no idea how to perform the uncrossing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the heuristic. You should get the solution with `model.getBestSol()` and extract the (directed) edges in the path from the solution. Then, loop over every pair of non-adjacent edges (i.e. edges that do not share vertices) and check if uncrossing them gives a better solution. When you find an uncrossing that yields a better solution, create a new solution with `model.createSol()` and set it to the new solution. Then add it to SCIP and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**\n",
    "* To build the (directed) edges of the path, it could be useful to build an adjacency list, i.e., for each node $i$, store the nodes that $i$ is connected to in the path. Then you can traverse the path and this traversal can provide a direction of the edges.\n",
    "* Since you know that the solution is feasible, you can directly add it without checking for feasibility. For this, you can use `model.addSol()`\n",
    "Assume the uncrossing of $e_1$ and $e_2$ gives the edges $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n",
    "* To check that the uncrossing yields a better solution, notice that the new solution value is the old solution value minus the costs of $e_1$ and $e_2$, plus the costs of $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n",
    "Therefore, the new solution value is better (smaller) than the old solution value if and only if\n",
    "$c_{f_1} + c_{f_2} < c_{e_1} + c_{e_2}$\n",
    "* If one of the variables $x_{f_i}$ is fixed to 0 or one of the variables $x_{e_i}$ is fixed to 1, then the uncrossing cannot be performed\n",
